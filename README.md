# Basketball Monster to Google Sheets
This is a webscraper made for a client. It scrapes tabled data from 7 pages and adds them to a Google Sheets file. It uses playwright to navigate to the necessary webpages, and the drop box values are chosen using selectors. This allows the script to be run on Apple OS, which usually doesn't allow the keyboard methods available in playwright. All sensitive information has been omitted from the code, and the credentials.json file has been excluded.
